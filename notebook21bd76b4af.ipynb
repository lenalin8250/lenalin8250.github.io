[Here](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest.html) is a helpful link on using the built in.\n\nThe syntax is: \n```bash\nproportions_ztest(count_array, nobs_array, alternative='larger')\n```\nwhere, \n- `count_array` = represents the number of \"converted\" for each group\n- `nobs_array` = represents the total number of observations (rows) in each group\n- `alternative` = choose one of the values from `[‘two-sided’, ‘smaller’, ‘larger’]` depending upon two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed respectively. \n>**Hint**: <br>\nIt's a two-tailed if you defined $H_1$ as $(p_{new} = p_{old})$. <br>\nIt's a left-tailed if you defined $H_1$ as $(p_{new} < p_{old})$. <br>\nIt's a right-tailed if you defined $H_1$ as $(p_{new} > p_{old})$. \n\nThe built-in function above will return the z_score, p_value. \n\n---\n### About the two-sample z-test\nRecall that you have plotted a distribution `p_diffs` representing the\ndifference in the \"converted\" probability  $(p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old})$  for your two simulated samples 10,000 times. \n\nAnother way for comparing the mean of two independent and normal distribution is a **two-sample z-test**. You can perform the Z-test to calculate the Z_score, as shown in the equation below:\n\n$$\nZ_{score} = \\frac{ (p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old}) - (p_{new}  -  p_{old})}{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{new} }{n_{new}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{old} }{n_{old}}  } }\n$$\n\nwhere,\n- $p{'}$ is the \"converted\" success rate in the sample\n- $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are the \"converted\" success rate for the two groups in the population. \n- $\\sigma_{new}$ and $\\sigma_{new}$ are the standard deviation for the two groups in the population. \n- $n_{new}$ and $n_{old}$ represent the size of the two groups or samples (it's same in our case)\n\n\n>Z-test is performed when the sample size is large, and the population variance is known. The z-score represents the distance between the two \"converted\" success rates in terms of the standard error. \n\nNext step is to make a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on comparing these two values: \n- $Z_{score}$\n- $Z_{\\alpha}$ or $Z_{0.05}$, also known as critical value at 95% confidence interval.  $Z_{0.05}$ is 1.645 for one-tailed tests,  and 1.960 for two-tailed test. You can determine the $Z_{\\alpha}$ from the z-table manually. \n\nDecide if your hypothesis is either a two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed test. Accordingly, reject OR fail to reject the  null based on the comparison between $Z_{score}$ and $Z_{\\alpha}$. We determine whether or not the $Z_{score}$ lies in the \"rejection region\" in the distribution. In other words, a \"rejection region\" is an interval where the null hypothesis is rejected iff the $Z_{score}$ lies in that region.\n\n>Hint:<br>\nFor a right-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ > $Z_{\\alpha}$. <br>\nFor a left-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ < $Z_{\\alpha}$. \n\n\n\n\nReference: \n- Example 9.1.2 on this [page](https://stats.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Statistics/Book%3A_Introductory_Statistics_(Shafer_and_Zhang)/09%3A_Two-Sample_Problems/9.01%3A_Comparison_of_Two_Population_Means-_Large_Independent_Samples), courtesy www.stats.libretexts.org\n\n---\n\n>**Tip**: You don't have to dive deeper into z-test for this exercise. **Try having an overview of what does z-score signify in general.** ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import statsmodels.api as sm\n# sm.stats.proportions_ztest() method arguments\n# It's a left-tailed\n\nz_score, p_value = sm.stats.proportions_ztest([convert_old, convert_new], [n_old, n_new], alternative='smaller')\nprint(z_score, p_value)","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**n.** What do the z-score and p-value you computed in the previous question mean for the conversion rates of the old and new pages?
